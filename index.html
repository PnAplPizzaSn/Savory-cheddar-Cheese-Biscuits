    <ol class="enhance"><strong><em>"Savory Cheddar Cheese Biscuits"</em></strong>
      </ol>
        <li>2 cups (227g) King Arthur Unbleached Self-Rising Flour</li>
        <li>4 ounces (113g) cheddar cheese, the sharper the better; we prefer Cabot extra-sharp</li>
        <li> cup (227g) heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="enhance"><strong><em>"Instructions"</em></strong></ul>
        <ol>
          <li class="instrcutions">Preheat your oven to 425Â°F, with a rack in the upper third.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">To make the biscuits using a food processor: Cut the cheese into a few chunks. Place the cheese and flour into the work bowl of your food processor.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">Process until the mixture is smooth; the cheese will be very finely chopped.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">Add the cream, and pulse until the dough becomes cohesive. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">To make the dough by hand: Grate or shred the cheese; you should have about 1 cup. Toss it together with the flour.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">Add the cream, stirring to make a cohesive dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.</li>
          <li>Pat the dough into a disc 3/4" to 1" thick; the thicker the disc, the taller the biscuits.</li>
          <li>Use a 2" cutter (or the size of your choice) to cut rounds. Place the biscuits on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops of the biscuits with cream or milk; this will help brown their crust.</li>
          <li>Bake the biscuits for 15 to 18 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and serve immediately.</li>
